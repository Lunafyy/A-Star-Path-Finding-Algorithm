# A-Star-Path-Finding-Algorithm

## Description
This program is designed to give a visual representation on the A* Path Finding Algorithm

## What is A*?
A* is a path finding algorithm that works by creating a priority queue of nodes and adding new nodes to the queue by checking the top node. These nodes are placed into the queue with a heuristic of distance to the end node, this means that the node at the top of the queue is always the closest node to the end node.

## How do I use it?
By holding left click and dragging your mouse you can draw shapes on the grid, these act as no-go nodes (a place that cannot be involved in the solution). You can also hold right click and drag over no-go nodes you've already drawn to remove them. Press SPACE to run the algorithm.
